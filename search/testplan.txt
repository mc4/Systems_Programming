test plan

We used two textfiles to test our sesarch. One was edited from the sample indexer given to us by the instructor/TA's. The othe was the output from our indexer assignment. 

The first is rawr2.txt which has the following contents:

<list> 123
/home/mike/Systems_Programmings/search/aa/bb/test.txt 1
</list>
<list> abc
/home/mike/Systems_Programmings/search/aa/a.txt 3 /home/mike/Systems_Programmings/search/aa/UntitledFolder/a.txt 3 /home/mike/Systems_Programmings/search/aa/bb/test.txt 2
</list>
<list> jashd

</list>
<list> newwordddd
/home/mike/Systems_Programmings/search/aa/a.txt 1 /home/mike/Systems_Programmings/search/aa/UntitledFolder/a.txt 1
